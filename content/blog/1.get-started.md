# About Parch Linux

Parch Linux is an open-source, Arch-based Linux distribution, that tried to be pretty, easy to use, light, fast and stable.

### Why do we call this Parch?

At the beginning of our work, we planned to make Parch a platform for Persian-speaking users, that's why we named it Parch ( Persian Arch ). But now we have more comprehensive goals than before.
