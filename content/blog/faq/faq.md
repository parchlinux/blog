Many people ask us **what is** Parch, **why we call this** Parch, etc. In this article, we answer these frequently asked questions.

### What is the Parch

The Parchlinux is a Linux distro based on **[Arch](https://archlinux.org)**, that tried to be **pretty**, **easy to use**, **light**, **fast** and **stable**.

### Why do we call this Parch?
