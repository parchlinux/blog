### Why do we call this Parch?

At the beginning of our work, we planned to make Parch a platform for Persian-speaking users, that's why we named it Parch ( Persian Arch ). But now we have more comprehensive goals than before.


## New Industry

Parch linux uses calamares graphical installer by default which makes it easier for you to install and use it.

Unlike any other proprietary operating systems, Parch Linux respects your privacy and doesn't collect any information or data from you.

Parch Linux requires at least 1.5 GB of RAM with xfce desktop and at least 1 GB with lxqt desktop Give your old system a second chance with Parch Linux.
